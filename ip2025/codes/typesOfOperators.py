# 1. Arithmetic operators (+,-,*,/,%, **(exponent)) -> number

# 2. Comparison Operators -> boolean value
    # > (greater than)
    # >= (greater than or equal to)
    # < (less than)
    # <= (less than or equal to)
    # == (checks if two values are equal)
    # != (not equal to )

# 3. assignment operator
    # = (assign the value)
    # += (add and assign)
    # -= (minus and assign)
    # *= (multiply and assign)
    # /= (divide and assign)
    # %= (modulus and assign)
    # **= (exponent and assign)

# Logical Operator -> bool value
# and
# or
# not
